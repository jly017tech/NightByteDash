<p>NightByteDash is an financial gui application shows three different charts: Revenue, Customers, and Products sold.
I design an application using Figma where I was brainstorming and creating few rectangular shapes, textboxes, and some icons.
I imported Matploit to create area chart, table chart, and ciruclar chart. I created data.py file and gets sales, table data, and revenue from NightByte company's data to show
in each graphs.
